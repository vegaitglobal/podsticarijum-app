# app_for_family_backup

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Project specific info
Before cloning the project, you should download the latest version of flutter and download the needed IDEs for coding in flutter.

### Architecture
* Networking will be done with https://pub.dev/packages/chopper.
* JSON serialization will be done with https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable.
* State management will be done with Provider (more info https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple).
* Navigation will be done with Navigator 1.0 for simplicity. Let's use namedRoutes even though they are discouraged in the documentation because they are discouraged because of reasons not relevant for us.
